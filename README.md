## Manual Instalation Guide
* Drop the .ipf file inside the TreeOfSavior/data folder, add a unicode character to the filename. The folder path usualy looks like this: `...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TreeOfSavior\data`
* Create a corresponding <addon name> folder inside TreeOfSavior/addons folder. The folder name should be the addon name without spaces and no caps.

Incase you're confused with what to add as unicode character, I suggest to use the snowman character.

## FPSSavior
Technically it's an EP13fix for FPSSavior derived from [Xinxs's FPSSavior](https://github.com/xinxs/ToS-Addons/tree/master/fpssavior) (which is derived from [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber)). The settings got modified further to accomodate large portion of the player base based on certain judgements.
