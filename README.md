## Manual Instalation Guide
* Drop the .ipf inside the TreeOfSavior/data folder, add a unicode character to the filename
* Create a corresponding <addon name> folder inside TreeOfSavior/addons folder

Incase you're confused with what to add as unicode character, I suggest to use the snowman character.

## FPSSavior
Technically it's an EP13fix for FPSSavior derived from [Xinxs's FPSSavior](https://github.com/xinxs/ToS-Addons/tree/master/fpssavior) (which is derived from [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber)). The settings got modified further to accomodate large portion of the player base based on certain judgements.
