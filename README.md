## FPSSavior
Technically it's an EP13fix derived from Xinxs's FPSSavior (which is derived from FiftyCaliber). The settings got modified further to accomodate large portion of the player base based on certain judgements.

Notes:
- Leaf on orsha are disabled only on UL, because it's related with boss gimmick, which cause a lot of trouble for people when it got disabled.

### commands:
- /fpssavior lock

  Lock/unlock the ui to move around.

- /fpssavior

  Toggle betwen modes.
