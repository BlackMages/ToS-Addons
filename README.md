## FPSSavior
Technically it's an EP13fix for FPSSavior derived from [Xinxs's FPSSavior](https://github.com/xinxs/ToS-Addons/tree/master/fpssavior) (which is derived from [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber)). The settings got modified further to accomodate large portion of the player base based on certain judgements.
